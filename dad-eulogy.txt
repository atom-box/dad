The Ken Genest I can describe will be just one facet of a man who had other facets too.

My earliest memory of my dad is rolls of masking tape.  
In our basement there were rolls and rolls of masking tape, hanging on pegboards none of it was the right color and none of it was the right size.  When I say masking tape you might picture blue, or green, or especially a sort of beige color.   
His rolls, which were everywhere: on the pegboard, stacked on the table, lost, behind a cabinet, were usually jet-black, or maybe silver, red, or green.  
I later found out that what he was doing with them was drawing.   He and the GM design center artists, were buying tape by the carton, in widths ranging from normal all the way down to 1/16".  What they were doing was drawing.  They were drawing cars on 15 foot long sheets of paper that they had tacked up on the wall.  
It wasn't something they learned outside of GM, it was something that they just started doing.  They had invented, years before computers, a way to lay down the darkest, sharpest line imaginable, and the reason the tape was so skinny was that they weren't just drawing straight lines, they were drawing these shapes like a cocacola bottle, and things that tapered to a point. 
In tape, they had found a linear version of clay.  What a knife could draw in 3D clay, tape could draw on 2D paper.  If you check Google Images for 'concept car', you'll see a lot of colored pencil or airbrush depictions, but the cousins of many of these designs were in clay or tape, an archivists nightmare, most of which were destroyed eventually.

I lied: there is an earlier memory of my dad's objects than tape: his coffee mug.  
When they warn you to kid-proof a house by removing the drinkable objects, they never tell you to watch where you leave your coffee cup.  
I would poke around, unsupervised, like a cat, sticking my nose into things that were less than 3' off the ground.   I learned to forage for coffee cups that my dad planted in his wake.  Grabbing them with both hands I would upend them and drink the single swallow that usually remained.  The coffee was of course cold, sugary, and about the color of a paper bag.

Why am I remembering him by his objects?  He was a little bit distant then.  Even if he were present, he would allow you some space.  He wouldn't ge tup in your face and try to be running the show.  He would listen and he would observe you.  He was comfortable being in a room with someone and letting them do their thing and he would do his. 

His team invented the design of two GM icons.  The Buick Riviera is a little less famous -- I actually have no idea what it looks like.  The Chevy Corvair is more famous, of the two.  He told me that his team liked what German's could do with a rear-engine, rear-drive setup.  The Porsche's but also the VW Bug.  We had one that was sky blue and later, sky blue with rust highlights.  Like many of the designers, Dad also had to have a two-seater.  His was a red, ragtop Fiat.  My two memories of the Fiat are Dad repairing the rust holes and of riding in it listening to Motown on the AM radio.  It was 1968 and I was three.

He sketched a bus for General Motors at some point.  I remember sitting in the front seat of his station wagon around 1978, and we watched a SEMTA bus go by and he sort of said vaguely "I think that's my design.  I did some drawings a long time ago and never knew where they ended up, but that is the basic shape of my bus: front, back, everything." 

There was a ten year period then when I stopped seeing him.   He started a family with Sharon, Billy, April, Gene, and Jimmy. We became a little estranged.  I was pretty occupied, becoming an adult, so I didn't totally notice.  But we must have had a phone call or some awkward chat in the mid-eighties and, making small talk, it came out that he was doing a lot of biking.  Like A TON.  Riding to work, buying a bike, inevitably buying another bike,  (a third even?).  Bikes became like a new sports car for him.  He stopped smoking, started talking a lot about 'Rails to Trails.'  Conversations would eventually circle around to advocating for making bicycle corridors wherever there were unused train tracks.  

We started meeting in parking lots around Rochester.  He'd show up with a couple of Treks or Gary Fishers on the roof rack.  The bikes gave us a very male way to talk to have something to talk about.  My family in general, not just him, doesn't do a lot of 'how have you been', "are you eating enough?"  We would chatter nonstop about how to weld aluminum, do you think a bike could be made from graphite, but how would you weld graphite, look at these handlebars (they were shaped like a giant paper clip), oh you got a flat, look that is called a 'snakebite' (when the rim pinches the tube, rolling over a big tree root).

These conversations were kind of the first time I met my dad.  Over the years, eventually I asked him enough questions to learn about the masking tape, the Bible, all the stories of his new family, why he fought and divorced my mom, what he remembered about his own dad, about his only sibling (Richard, a year older and 3x more 'energetic'), what did he do in the Army, why did he become an artist.

I recorded interviews with him twice.  I wish I could do a third interview.  If he would agree to it, I would interview him one more time.  I'd show him a palette of colors, ask him which were his favorites, and why.  I would like to ask him whether it made him uncomfortable that we are politically opposite -- he has obviously accomodated it somehow, because it never seemed to be a barrier to our relationship.  

He is unsmiling in many of his photos, but not later in life.  In his last ten years he has a mellowed, pleased expression.  I'd like to show him photos of himself from each decade and ask him to explain the expression on his face.  

His expressions and actions live on.  When I see my two sisters, I see them act and talk in ways that aren't like me, and often I recognize it as a little glimpse of my dad.  In these, he is still with us. 

In other ways, he is gone.  His personality was really unique.  He was a bit incommunicative, with a rich inner life.  A bit passive, but also, calm, reflective.  Towards the end, wise.  Very sober.  He had the winking humor of his dad, giving a pinch when you weren't looking.  Lying on his hospital bed last week, when ALS had stolen from him almost all of his movement, even the ability to breathe, finally, and deafness had taken his ability to freely communicate, and the mask had taken his ability to speak, he played footsie with me.  I could hardly believe it.   I would look away and there'd be a tap and I'd look back and he would be looking somewhere else. A total straight-faced joker.  So much love in his humor.   

I want to mention one more piece of GM Tech that we should be proud of is the names on the sides of the vehicles.  When you see Chevy and GMC trucks like the Silverado, the name on the tailgate is from his group.  GM made their own font and Dad would set the letters up into the name, doing the kerning and sizing with a penknife and rubber cement.  
He also generated an enormous number of Jesus logos around this time.  
As you leave here today, I hope you will notice the back ends of these vehicles when you are at stoplights because it is a reminder of the numerous little piece of him that is still alive.
