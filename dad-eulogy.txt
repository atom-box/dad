I rode bikes with my dad many times, always on dirt, always on someplace out in the woods.  I'm Ken's son, Evan.  Here today is my sister Amy, my sister Lisa is in Arizona, and my wife Meg is back in Wisconsin holding down the fort. 
I have a sort of secret memory from my dad.  These stories die when we die -- unless we share them out loud.  
In 1971 he and my mom decided that I would join a neighborhood father and son group.  The only requirement was that you were a kid and that you brought your dad.  You can picture us, some 6 year olds sitting cross-legged in a circle on the carpet, each one backed by a dad in a chair.  It was native-american themed, and when you were new, you had a headress with a single feather.  As you passed tests you acquired a feather for each test.  It was called Indian Guides.  The YMCA ran it.  

The other childhood memory I will share is his rolls of masking tape.  
Unlike the masking tape at other people's house, none of ours was the right color, that masking tape color, and none of it was the right size.  His rolls were usually jet-black, or maybe silver, red, or green.  This masking tape was everywhere: on the pegboard, stacked on the table, lost, behind a cabinet, or in drawers, buried in piles of tools for making art. 
And what I later found out that the tape was a kind of pen for him, a way to draw things.  He and the GM Design Center artists, were buying tape by the carton, in widths ranging from normal all the way down to 1/16".   With it they were drawing cars on 15 foot long sheets of paper that they had tacked up on the wall.  

My dad wasn't sure who started drawing with the tape but he felt it was someone there at the Design Center.  They had invented, years before computers, a way to lay down the darkest, sharpest line imaginable on these enormous pieces of paper, drawing in 1:1 scale, I think.  The drawings all fell apart after a couple years in a drawer of course, so all we have are the archivist drawings -- hopefully.

Dad talked a lot about his work at GM.  He came home from the Tech Center talking about streamlining and wind tunnels.  He started talking about crash-test dummies and about how in the future, cars would add a second seatbelt for your upper body.  He said GM had learned to make a bag that could explode from the steering wheel center but that noone could imagine it making it into production.    

His team at GM brought two major designs to market.  The Buick Riviera I actually have no idea what it looks like.  But the Chevy Corvair is an icon of the 60s, much more famous.  He told me that his team was going for was the excitement of a German rear-engine, rear-drive setup, like a Porsche or a VW Bug.  The engineering of the Corvair (not my dad's job) included a rear suspension that was a little ahead of it's time which, unfortunately would sometimes flip the car over and kill the occupants.  General Motors fixed this part of the design in later years but dropped the Corvair entirely after ____.  I drove a Corvair once.  I found it extremely fun.  The steering was pretty hard to describe but it was nothing like any car you've ever driven; I highly recommend it.  

He sketched a bus for General Motors at some point.  I remember sitting parked in my dad's station wagon around 1978, and we watched one of the new SEMTA buses go by and he sort of said vaguely "I think that's my design.  I did some drawings a long time ago and never knew where they ended up, but that is the basic shape of my bus: front, back, everything." 

He always said he went to Riverdale High.  That was because the town of ____ NH was where ____ went to high school, a few years ahead of Ken.  Dad's art teacher there, name unknown, told my dad that you could make a living in art, his teacher told him that you had to go away, to New York or Providence, and learn how to design.  It really opened my dad's eyes and sent him on a trajectory that brought him first to Pratt Institute, and then here to Michigan.  So we should think about that fellow who said those words in 1949 to the little teenaged Ken Genest.  In Dad's life, that little brief push lives on.  

There was a ten year period then when I stopped seeing him.  He and my mom divorced, I became a teenager, and he started a family with Sharon, Billy, April, Gene, and Jimmy. We became a little estranged.  

I think we had a phone call or some awkward chat in the mid-eighties and, making small talk, it came out that he was doing a lot of biking.  Like A TON.  Riding to work, buying a bike, inevitably buying another bike,  (a third even?).  Bikes became like a new sports car for him.  He stopped smoking, started talking a lot about 'Rails to Trails.'  Conversations would eventually circle around to advocating for making bicycle corridors wherever there were unused train tracks.  He said trails were really where it was at for bikes and that I should come try it.

We started meeting in parking lots around Rochester.  He'd show up with a couple of Treks or Gary Fishers on the roof rack, the first I had ever seen with a large tubing frame or front suspenion.  The bikes gave us a very male way to talk to have something to talk about.  My family in general, not just him, doesn't do a lot of 'how have you been', "are you eating enough?"  We would chatter nonstop about how to weld aluminum, do you think a bike could be made from graphite, but how would you weld graphite, look at these handlebars (they were shaped like a giant paper clip),  oh you got a flat-tire, look that is called a 'snakebite' (when the rim pinches the tube, rolling over a big tree root).
I don't know if this is touching or a little bit weak but, the #1 piece of advice I ever got from my dad, and that I use more or less daily now, is 'lean just the back wheel agains an object, that way the bike won't fall over. The guys that ride for Sterling Schwinn taught me that.'

I recorded interviews with him twice.  I wish I could do a third interview.  If he would agree to it, I would interview him one more time.  I'd show him a palette of colors, ask him which were his favorites, and why.  I'd like to show him a photo of himself at each age of his life and ask him why he's not smiling in most of them.    I would like to ask him whether it made him uncomfortable that we are politically opposite -- he has obviously accomodated it somehow, because it never seemed to be a barrier to our relationship.  

It is true that he is unsmiling in many of his photos.  Much of that is attributable to the fact that he was from New England.  But photos from his last ten years have a mellowed, pleased expression.  He knew how to give and receive love and he knew that he was well-loved by that point.  And when he passed away two weeks ago he knew he was not alone, he knew that he was surrounded by his family.

He had inherited the winking humor of his own dad, Arthur Genest, giving a pinch when you weren't looking.  Lying on his hospital bed last week, when ALS had stolen from him almost all of his movement, even the ability to breathe, finally, and deafness had taken his ability to freely communicate, and the mask had taken his ability to speak, he played footsie with me.  I could hardly believe it.   I would look away and there'd be a tap and I'd look back and he would be looking somewhere else. A total straight-faced joker.  So much love in his humor.
